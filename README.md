This repository contains only the main code of the project, so it may not work properly without the required libraries.
To this project we use the Edubot Modded Library (https://github.com/pinxau1000/Robot_Edubot_S_v2_0_MODED) and the FreeRTOS modded library (https://github.com/pinxau1000/FreeRTOS_AVR_MODED).
