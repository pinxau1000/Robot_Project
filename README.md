# Robot_Project
The maze solver robot project.

This repository contains only the main code of the project, so it may not work properly without the required libraries.
To this project we use the Edubot Modded Library (https://github.com/pinxau1000/Robot_Edubot_S_v2_0_MODED) and the FreeRTOS modded library (https://github.com/pinxau1000/FreeRTOS_AVR_MODED).
